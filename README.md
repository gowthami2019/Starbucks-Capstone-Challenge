### Project Overview
- The program used to create the data simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers.
- Each person in the simulation has some hidden traits that influence their purchasing patterns and are associated with their observable traits. People produce various events, including receiving offers, opening offers, and making purchases.
- As a simplification, there are no explicit products to track. Only the amounts of each transaction or offer are recorded.
- There are three types of offers that can be sent: buy-one-get-one (BOGO), discount, and informational. In a BOGO offer, a user needs to spend a certain amount to get a reward equal to that threshold amount. In a discount, a user gains a reward equal to a fraction of the amount spent. In an informational offer, there is no reward, but neither is there a requisite amount that the user is expected to spend. Offers can be delivered via multiple channels.
- The basic task is to use the data to identify which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer, and how best to present each type of offer.

### Problem Statement
- How could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. 
- How could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer? Or, you donâ€™t need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A).
